	<h1>About "Junkios"
  </h1> I hesitated to add this image to my portfolio. It was made for the ART75 class at SJSU, during my first round of attendance here. This is the file that was printed out and glued onto a regular cereal box of Cheerios. As the viewer can tell, "Junkios" deals very heavily with prescription-drug abuse, which I was struggling with at the time of creating it. I hesitated to include this into my portfolio as it represents a very dark period of my life, but I have since gotten sober, and so I thought including it would pay homage to my journey.
