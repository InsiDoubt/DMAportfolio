	<h1>Artist Statment
	<span></span>
  </h1>
	<p>As a kid I was fascinated by the cartoons I saw on television, the products of Hannah Barbera and Disney. I quickly grew enamored with the concept of using art as a method for storytelling, for conveying emotion and for expressing oneself. My initial forays into the art field were solo ventures; sitting at my desk during classes and drawing my hands, over and over, until I produced something with which I was satisfied. Nevertheless, at that time, the space my art occupied was as a mere hobby for me, albeit one of deep passion.</p>
	<p>When I had to consider what to study in college, my father expressed to me that studying art was a foolish endeavor, that he wanted me to get a degree I would be able to use professionally. As I thought more on the issue, I realized my fatherâ€™s hesitations were his own, owing to his degree in electrical engineering. I simultaneously realized that art was the only thing I wanted to study, and so I made the decision to enroll at San Jose State as a Digital Media Art major. A few years later, I worked my way into a position as a graphic designer within the online auto marketing industry. </p> 
	<p>Working within the professional setting has allowed me to examine my process as an artist. Strict guidelines put forth by brands like Mercedes-Benz, Ford, and Toyota require a greater degree of enginuity to incorporate personal style into advertisements. My designs tend to be streamlined and elegant, utilizing hard lines to convey flow through self-generated shapes. Additionally, the industry requires attention to a large volume of ads (I am involved with the creation of between 30 and 70 ads daily) which has improved my focus on producing creative in a manner that is efficient, accurate, and appealing.</p>
	<p>I do, however, wish to distinguish between my professional work and my personal endeavors as an artist. In the art that I create on my own time, I work primarily digitally and with ink. I favor art that is monochromatic and thusly stark and contrasting. This high-contrast work melds directly with a central theme of my artwork: Dichotomy. I am fascinated by the idea of something being itself and its opposite, simultaneously. My scenes of elegance and beauty are perforated by macabre depictions of bared bones, but both elements are handled with the same level of care. This process ensures that the viewer will be unable to tell which is the beauty and which is the horror.</p></section>
