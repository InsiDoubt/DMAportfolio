	<h1>About "Burcursion"
  </h1> Burgcursion, or "Burger Recursion," as was the intended title, was made for ART02, Medium And Message. The assignment description was to create a work that pushed the limits of a medium, or what that medium represents. I am quite fond of things that are equally disgusting and beautiful, and so my mind immediately went to rotting food and painting. Thus, "Burcursion" is made entirely of the ingredients one can use to make a burger. The bun is made from a mixture of ketchup and mustard, the patty is barbeque sauce, the tomatoes are ketchup, and the lettuce is actual lettuce.
